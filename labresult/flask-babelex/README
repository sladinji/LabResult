Flask-BabelEx

Implements i18n and l10n support for Flask.  This is fork of the official Flask-Babel
extension with additional features:

1. It is possible to use multiple language catalogs in one Flask application;
2. Localization domains: your extension can package localization file(s) and use them
   if necessary;
3. Does not reload localizations for each request.

Flask-BabelEx is API-compatible with Flask-Babel.
